## 1. Purpose and Scope  

This statement defines the ethical principles and reflective practices that guide my learning, documentation, and public experimentation in this repository.  

It serves as a **personal compass** whenever I am in doubt — influenced by the writing practices of technologists like *Gergely Orosz*, and by the reflective, learner-centered ethos I imbibed from my thesis co-supervisor *Prof. Sridhar Iyer*.  

The scope extends beyond code: it includes pedagogical design, journaling, architectural reasoning, and the meta-learning processes that occur through AI-augmented reflection. This is a **living document**, revised as I evolve as a learner, teacher, and practitioner.

## 2. Integrity, Transparency, and Conflicts of Interest  

I commit to recording both what worked and what failed — including partial insights, wrong turns, and unverified hypotheses. The aim is to make my learning traceable and honest, not polished or performative.  

I will clearly mark **assumptions, uncertainties, and conflicts of interest**, especially where my prior experience may influence interpretation. For transparency:  

- I have contributed to and currently work on projects **built on top of Google Course Builder**, notably *SWAYAM* and *SEEK*.  
- I am aware of architectural and operational challenges in these systems that may shape my opinions.  
- I am a licensed user of **ChatGPT** and **Claude**, and frequently use both for ideation, summarization, and reflection.  

Declaring these influences is not an admission of bias, but an acknowledgment of context — so readers can interpret my reflections with appropriate perspective.

## 3. Attribution and Referencing  

I believe citation is a gesture of respect and intellectual honesty. Every time I draw on external material — from research papers to blog posts to AI outputs — I will **attribute the source using IEEE-style referencing**, even in informal documents.  

Example format:  
> [1] S. Willison, "On Link Blogs," *simonwillison.net*, Dec. 2024. [Online]. Available: https://simonwillison.net/2024/Dec/22/link-blog/

AI-generated text or ideas will also be cited with a timestamp and prompt context wherever relevant.  

Attribution, in my view, is not bureaucracy; it’s a trace of the lineage of ideas that shape my understanding.

## 4. Responsible and Transparent Use of AI  

AI is central to my workflow — as **a collaborator, evaluator, and reflective partner**. I use it in three main capacities:  

1. **As a collaborator**, to co-generate structure, plans, and draft ideas.  
2. **As an evaluator**, to critique, cross-check, or highlight gaps in reasoning.  
3. **As a reflection companion**, to surface alternative perspectives and challenge assumptions.  

Every AI-assisted artifact in this repo will make that role explicit. AI outputs will not be used without **human review, validation, and contextualization**.  

I acknowledge that **AI systems embed biases** — both in training data and in prompt design. Therefore, I will:  
- Record the **prompt(s)** used for significant outputs.  
- Reflect explicitly on **how the phrasing of a prompt** might have influenced the result.  
- Revise outputs with **my own reasoning and accountability** before publishing.  

AI will not be used to simulate others’ voices, opinions, or proprietary reasoning.

## 5. AI Ethics and Reflective Practice  

As I continue to rely on AI tools, I will anchor my usage in these guiding principles:  

- **Transparency** — always disclose when content is AI-assisted.  
- **Accountability** — take ownership of the final artifact, even when AI contributed.  
- **Fairness** — avoid using AI to summarize or reframe others’ work without proper context or permission.  
- **Bias awareness** — reflect on the social, linguistic, and epistemic biases that AI might introduce.  
- **Reflective vigilance** — treat AI not as a truth engine but as a mirror that reveals my framing, assumptions, and blind spots.  

---

## 6. Ethics of Experimentation  

Every experiment — whether technical, pedagogical, or methodological — will include a clear **intent**, a description of **process**, and a candid **reflection on outcomes**.  

Failure is treated as a **primary learning artifact**, not an afterthought. Recording it honestly contributes to collective understanding and prevents “invisible mistakes” in future replications.  

I will avoid experiments that:  
- Misrepresent others’ work or ideas.  
- Use non-consensual data.  
- Make claims beyond available evidence.  

Each experiment report will **link back to this ethics statement** as its moral and methodological foundation.  

---

## 7. Learning in Public and Pedagogical Use  

I publish this work openly to learn in public and to model reflective practice for learners and educators.  
I often draw from these experiences in **faculty development sessions, workshops, and talks** — using them as **“teachable moments”** to demonstrate authentic learning processes.  

In those contexts, I will:  
- Represent failures and revisions with honesty.  
- Clarify when examples are simplified or anonymized for pedagogical clarity.  
- Attribute collaborators and co-learners wherever relevant.  

Learning in public is a privilege that demands humility — not performance.  

---

## 8. Privacy, Data, and Consent  

Where experiments or discussions involve references to individuals, data, or collaborative projects:  
- I will anonymize or seek consent before publication.  
- I will respect the privacy policies of organizations I am part of (including those of SWAYAM and SEEK).  
- I will refrain from sharing any confidential or sensitive technical details.  

---

## 9. Revision and Evolution  

This statement will be revisited **quarterly** and updated as my practices evolve.  
Each update will include a brief changelog noting what has been added or reinterpreted.  

> “Ethics is not a boundary but a rhythm — it must be practiced to remain alive.”

## 10. Reflection Checklist  

Before publishing any new **experiment**, **journal entry**, or **artifact**, I will pause to ask:  

1. **Transparency:** Have I clearly stated what is my own work, what is derived, and what is AI-assisted?  
2. **Attribution:** Have I cited or linked to every external idea, source, or person who influenced this work?  
3. **Integrity:** Am I representing results — including failures or uncertainties — truthfully?  
4. **Impact:** Could this content unintentionally misrepresent, harm, or expose private information about others?  
5. **Reflection:** What did this artifact teach me about *how* I learn, not just *what* I learned?  

If I hesitate on any of these questions, I will delay publication and revise accordingly.

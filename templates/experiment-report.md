## 🎯 Purpose

> Why does this experiment exist?

Describe the motivation behind this experiment:  
- What question are you trying to answer?  
- What hypothesis or curiosity initiated it?  
- How does this tie to your broader learning roadmap or architectural exploration?  

_Example:_ “I wanted to test if journaling structure influences depth of weekly reflection.”

## 🧩 Context & Background

> Outline what you knew going in, and what constraints or assumptions you had.

- Prior knowledge or references:  
  - [ ] Previous experiments  
  - [ ] External readings or examples  
  - [ ] Known gaps or uncertainties  
- Relevant links or notes:  
  - Docs, repos, or sources of inspiration

## 🧰 Setup & Approach

> How did you run the experiment?

1. **Preparation:** What setup, environment, or materials did you use?  
2. **Procedure:** Step-by-step actions or iterations performed.  
3. **Variations:** If you tried different methods, list them here.  
4. **AI / Tools Used (if any):**  
   - Which tools (e.g., ChatGPT, Claude, GitHub Copilot, etc.)  
   - Nature of assistance (drafting, debugging, ideation, etc.)

## 📊 Observations & Results

> What actually happened — not what you expected.

- **Quantitative outcomes:** (if applicable)  
  - e.g., Performance data, number of issues found, etc.  
- **Qualitative outcomes:**  
  - What surprised you, confused you, or inspired you.  
  - Include screenshots, snippets, or diagrams under `/artifacts/`.  
- **Unexpected outcomes or side-effects:**  
  - Any insights that emerged unintentionally.  

🪶 *Remember: failed or inconclusive results are equally valuable.*  

---

## ❌ Failure & Friction Analysis

> Capture what didn’t work and **why** you think it failed.

- Which assumptions broke?  
- Were there environmental, conceptual, or human errors?  
- How did this failure clarify something important?  
- What would you do differently next time?

> “Failure is not the opposite of success — it’s the diagnostic pathway to it.”

## 🌱 Learnings & Insights

> Translate raw observations into structured understanding.

| Type | Insight / Takeaway |
|------|---------------------|
| Technical | |
| Conceptual | |
| Pedagogical / Process | |
| Meta (about yourself) | |

Optional:  
> Link relevant TIL entries or weekly journals here for continuity.

## 🧭 Reflection Questions (for self and readers)

> Designed to provoke deeper thinking and invite others to re-run or reinterpret the experiment.

1. If you were to **reproduce this experiment**, what would you keep identical — and what would you change?  
2. What **biases or assumptions** shaped your original hypothesis?  
3. How could someone else **extend this experiment** (technically or pedagogically)?  
4. What does this experiment **teach about learning itself**?  
5. What’s one sentence you’d tell your “pre-experiment” self?

---

## 🧑‍🏫 Teachable Moment (optional but encouraged)

> Frame a small, replicable activity that others can try.

**Example Structure:**
- **Objective:** Learn how journaling format affects reflection quality.  
- **Steps:**  
  1. Try writing a journal entry in two formats — bullet-based vs. narrative.  
  2. Compare emotional recall or insight density.  
- **Expected Insight:** Which structure encourages deeper self-explanation?

## ⚖️ Ethics & Integrity Note

> Each experiment should adhere to a personal ethics framework that ensures respect, transparency, and intellectual honesty.

**Ethics Reference:** [Personal Ethics Statement](../admin/personal-ethics.md)

Before sharing or publishing results:
- Ensure any AI-assisted outputs are clearly attributed.  
- Avoid unacknowledged reuse of copyrighted or closed-source material.  
- Be mindful when interpreting human or social data (if any).  
- Treat every experiment as part of a collective learning ecosystem, not competition.

## 🪞 Final Reflection

**Key takeaway in one line:**  
> _e.g., “Structure doesn’t limit creativity — it anchors it.”_

**Next Steps / Follow-ups:**
- [ ] Repeat with modified setup  
- [ ] Convert into ADR / formal documentation  
- [ ] Write blog / postmortem summary  
- [ ] Archive for later reflection

It would be better if I start working on the base templates as this will help in structuring the activities while trying to follow the roadmap. Lets start with the Weekly Journal template.

A weekly journal, even though very personal, should have the following characteristics that others can abstract from:
- The initial plan for the week that was thought (which is entered at the start of the week)
- Several TIL notes that explains new learnings that are part and parcel of any learning journey
- Have points similar to the idea of link blog that Simon Willison explains in https://simonwillison.net/2024/Dec/22/link-blog/
- In addition, there should be teachable moments where I can provide activities for readers of the repo

The full prompt was broken down into two sub prompts. The first one providing me with a sample structure for the ethics statement and the second one where I personalize the structure with my inputs.

## Prompt 1
What all are the key points to be included in the personal ethics statement?

## Prompt 2
Yes, draft my first personal-ethics statement. Here are some of my thoughts on the various sections pointed out earlier:
1. Totally aligned on the purpose and scope. However, I'm also influenced by several other tech bloggers like Gergely Orosz, my thesis co-supervisor Prof. Sridhar Iyer to keep a personal statement for myself that can guide me whenever I am in doubt
2. While talking about results and assumptions, I should also add about any existing conflict of interests that I have with whatever I am writing on. For instance, I am working on multiple projects that have built on top of the Course Builder - SWAYAM and SEEK, and am familiar with many of its existing issues and architectures that were created to circumvent it. I also use AI heavily - ChatGPT and Claude and am a licensed user for both.
3. While attributing, it would be good to have an IEEE style of referencing
4. While talking about AI use, I should also talk about how I use AI as an evaluator
5. I should also talk about how I use these learning resources in several of my sessions that I take for faculty, as I see reflection moments while doing these activities
6. Add AI ethics as well, as many will also bias of the prompt that I used while drafting the experiment plan

## Prompt 3
Yes, add the reflection checklist here

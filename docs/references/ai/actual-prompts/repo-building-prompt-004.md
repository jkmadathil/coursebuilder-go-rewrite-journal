Yes, an Experiment Report Template will be ideal. 
- Do not limit it to technical experiments, as even pedagogical experiments like creation of this repo is a valid use case for experimentation
- Not every experiments may be successful. However, recording failures are even more critical than writing about successes. Ensure that experiment report template highlights this
- There should be a personal ethics statement that should be linked in each experiment report
- Every person will have their own idea of experimentation, hence it is important to have pointed reflection questions that forces the reader to think about how they would have done the experiment differently

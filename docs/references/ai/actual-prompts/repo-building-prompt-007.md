Since this was towards end of the conversation, I have used single line prompts for most of the conversations. Collating all these prompts below

## Prompt 1 
Now, let us try populating the adr-template.

## Prompt 2
Yes, create the 0001-initial-repo-structure.md

## Prompt 3
Are the references example ones or actual ones? Because both 2 and 3 seems to be not available

## Prompt 4
I will add these manually. What should the module-mappings.csv look like? Is it a complete mapping of the files (which I have already taken) or does it add some more info and make it a little more learner-friendly?

## Prompt 5
Attached is module map for entire coursebuilder. Can you create the initial modulemap.csv based on this?

## Prompt 6
Yes, generate the companion file. Also tell me the ideal place to store this - Is it under templates/ or docs/module-maps/ ?

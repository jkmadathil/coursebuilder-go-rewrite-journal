This file contains the unedited prompts issued to ChatGPT during the CourseBuilder→Go project.  
These are preserved verbatim for reproducibility, meta-analysis, and future prompt-engineering refinement.

---

## Prompt 1
I'm planning to rewrite Google Course Builder in Go. The repository can be found at: https://github.com/google/coursebuilder-core

Is there a way I can get the architecture document to understand the modules in this codebase?

---

## Prompt 2
Will it be possible for you to go through the code repo of course builder?

---

## Prompt 3
Create a high-level architecture diagram first and suggest modifications to reflect the containerized application deployment (like CloudRun or GKE) that is available at the moment.

---

## Prompt 4
Produce a detailed file→module map.

---

## Prompt 5
I am looking at a microservices migration plan.

---

## Prompt 6
Attached is a zip of the coursebuilder-core. Can you create a precise file-module spreadsheet?

---

## Prompt 7
If I told you that i do not have any background on Application Development, can you provide me a 3 month plan (Assuming I will be able to devote 5 hours every week) to understand the architecture of coursebuilder and how a web application works?

---

## Prompt 8
Can I install coursebuilder in my local machine (Ubuntu Linux) and get my hands dirty? Does it need a cloud subscription?

---

## Prompt 9
Provide a Dockerfile first, then provide step-by-step instructions on using it.

---

## Prompt 10
What if I plan to learn WebApp development by using the CourseBuilder migration project in GO? Can you provide me a 6 month plan to proceed? The plan should consider the fact that 
- I have only 5 hours to spend in a week for learning and development, 
- I like doing hands-on first and then learning theory, 
- I have some basic understanding of CourseBuilder functionalities
- I do have some basic Python scripting experience
- I do have subscriptions to Claude (Pro) and ChatGPT

---

## Prompt 11
I would want to make a harder commitment by converting the current plan as part of a Github repo. This repo will be both my journaling space and space to reflect back on the learning process. This repo will not have any code, rather will have steps, resources referred, key challenges, learnings from the challenges, things where AI didn't work etc. I need to create a strategic plan for the folder architecture first and then move step by step.

---

## Prompt 12
I need to synthesize all the prompts that I have used in this chat so that I can add it to a file ai-prompts.md.

While creating the markdown file, it will be useful to comment on what the prompt helps in and also provide a critical evaluation of it to recommend better prompting strategies to obtain a much better output.

---

## Prompt 13
Many of the prompts given in the ai-prompts.md seems to be summary of the actual prompts that I gave. Is there a way to concatenate the actual prompts as is in an md file?
